## Review

Video gamers and personality: A five-factor model to understand game playing style. Psychology of Popular Media Culture.

This paper uses the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality measurements to categorize World of Warcraft (WoW) players based on server playing style and character specialization. 

The hypotheses analyzed were:
* WoW players will choose their main character based in part on the personality traints of the player.
* Players will exhibit different personality attributes between the variety of character classes, races, and specializations.
* Server playing styles are affected by different personality characteristics.

Over 1200 players participated in the study, which found that female players scored higher than male players in agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness. Statistically significant personality dimensions for extraversion, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and agreeablness were also found depending on server playing styles.
